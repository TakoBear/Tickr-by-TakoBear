To know more, just check this class.

Follow the sample code to init and append to your view 
``` objective-c
    dropMenu= [[JMDropMenuView alloc] initWithViews:@[cameraDrop, albumDrop, searchDrop]];
    dropMenu.frame = CGRectMake(self.view.bounds.size.width - kAddMenuIconSize, 70, kAddMenuIconSize, kAddMenuIconSize *3);
    dropMenu.animateInterval = 0.15;
    dropMenu.delegate = self;
    dropMenu.userInteractionEnabled = NO;
    [self.view addSubview:dropMenu];
```

Note that property animateInterval can control the animate time.
We set the default time as 0.5 sec.
To dismiss the menu, use the following method after init..

``` objective-c
[dropMenu dismiss];
```

To pop out the menu, just use the method 

``` objective-c
[dropMenu popOut];
```
